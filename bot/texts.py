{EMOJI['check']} **3**)  do not join until instructed to do so by the botte
{EMOJI['check']} **4**)  don't ask the host to join, for their friend code, or what the raid code is‚Äî**i'll tell you all of that when it's your turn** {EMOJI["flop"]}
{EMOJI['check']} **5**)  when you're done raiding, you **have** to leave the raid by **unclicking** the {EMOJI["pokeball"]} or {EMOJI["masterball"]} in <#{active_raids_id}> or by typing `.leave`
{EMOJI['check']} **6**)  you must also **remove the host from your friend's list**, even if you intend to raid with them again later!
{EMOJI['check']} **7**)  **you can rejoin** at any time (unless you've used a {EMOJI["masterball"]})
{EMOJI['check']} **8**)  hosts are completely free to remove users for **any reason whatsoever, no questions asked**! this is their room and they do not have to host you.
{EMOJI['check']} **9**)  don't react to a kick or block! **hosts do not have to explain why they blocked you.** if this happens, please contact mods.
{EMOJI['check']} **10**)  if you joined with a {EMOJI["pokeball"]}, you can switch to a masterball **once** by going back to <#{active_raids_id}> and clicking the {EMOJI["masterball"]} (but you better use one or you'll get blocked!)
{EMOJI['check']} **11**)  when you've caught the Pok√©mon, please write `.caught`!

{EMOJI['check']} **2**)  if someone is unnecessarily greedy, hostile, joins out of order, spammy or worse - just `block` them
{EMOJI['check']} **3**)  if a trainers "forgets" to use their masterball when they sign up as {EMOJI["masterball"]} _definitely_ block them
{EMOJI['check']} **4**)  **do not go afk when hosting!** _you cannot pause raids._ if you wait 30 minutes, it's likely many of the users in your pool will be away and the whole thing falls apart
{EMOJI['check']} **5**)  you can, however, `.end` the raid and create a new one when you're back! it'll work just as good :))
{EMOJI['check']} **6**)  `.skip` `.remove` or `.block` anyone who is afk during their turn (removed and blocked users **cannot rejoin**)
